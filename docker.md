### For windows user

Windows Home user will not be able install the Docker for Windows Desktop edition, as it requires Hyper-V virtualization. This is supported only by Windows Professional and Enterprise editions.  
 Windows Home users will need to install Docker Toolbox which uses VirtualBox instead.

Toolbox will install everything you need including VirtualBox.
You may also need to enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS settings.
