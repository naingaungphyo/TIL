## Installation

### For Mac users

Download and install Docker for Mac.  
 `https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/`

### For Windows users

Windows Home users will not be able install the Docker for Windows Desktop edition, as it requires Hyper-V virtualization. This is supported only by Windows Professional and Enterprise editions.

Windows Home users will need to install Docker Toolbox which uses VirtualBox instead.
`https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/`

Toolbox will install everything you need including VirtualBox.
You may also need to enable virtualization in your computer's BIOS settings.
